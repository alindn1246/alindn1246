### Hi there ğŸ‘‹



ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a dynamic web application using React.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React concepts and state management.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development.
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing performance in React applications.
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, CSS, or front-end development.
âš¡ Fun fact: I once wrote a recursive function that generated a fractal tree in JavaScript! ğŸŒ³
